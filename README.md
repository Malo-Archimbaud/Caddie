# Caddie

Moonshot project for the school ALGOSUP

## General view

Caddie is an application that allows golf players to make the best decision for every shot they have to make.

It will help players thanks to an algorithm that guides them on where to aim and how far they should try to go.

The app will collect the localization of the user to adjust its advice in the function of the course.

It will also collect data on the user such as the distance he can send the ball to and his scores to adapt to the user level.

The app will also provide all the rules and advice on what to do in each situation.

## Objectives

- Help a golf player improve his level
- Adapt a new course easier
- Analyse his results to evaluate his level and give proper advice
