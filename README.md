Moonshot project for the school ALGOSUP

General view

Caddie is an application with a camera that allows golf players to make the best decision for every shot they have to make.

It will help the players thanks to an AI assistant which guides him on where to aim and how far he should try to go.

The camera is here to scan the playerâ€™s swing depending on what the player wants to focus on. If used for the swing, the app will show him what to correct to improve his swing.

The app will collect the localisation of the user to adjust its advice in function of the course and the weather.

It will also collect data on the user such as the distance he can send the ball to and his scores to adapt on the user level.

The app will also provide all the rules and give advice on what to do in each situation.

Objectives
- Help a golf player improve his level
- Make the adaptation on a new course easier
- Analyse his results to evaluate his level and give proper advice
