# Functional Specification

## Context

Caddie is an application that will help golf players making better decisions when playing by. It will also help improving their level by analysing their score and give feedbaack on what to work on. Caddie will also adapts its advice according to the level of the player to give the best experience to the user

## Goal and Scope

The goal is to create an app that will help golf players improve. The app will be divided with different functionalities:

- The main one, which is tracking the position of the player and propose a the next shot. For that, the app should have access to the localisation, but use a minimal percentage of battery. The app should be able to tell how long the player walk to the ball and propose the next shot to the remaining distance. The app will also be able to adjust its advice depending on previous shots.
- The next feature will be the score storage. Any game played should be available to one year prior. This will allow to see how he evolved and where he has difficulties.
- The next one is the training one. The user will be able to give his best distance with each kind of clubs. Then, the app will be able to refine the calcuclations to find the best shot in every situation
- The last one is the rule book. The app have all the rules to date to allow the user to ask the app if he needs reminder. The app will also be able to give the best solution according to the situation.

## Functional requirements

The app will be able to locate the user's position. The app will be able to detect a stop when the player is walking to his ball. It will be then able to calculate the distance reached with the shot, what is the current score of the player and what is his next best possible shot.

The app will also be able to save the scores the user did on each hole of a course, the total score and where did the user play.

The app will also be able to refine his recommandations via training session. The user will enter the distance he can do with each club. After every game played, calculation will be done to always refine what the user is capable of, and thus given more and more correct estimation.

The app will also be able to provide solution if the user is not sure of the exact rule that should be applied in a specific scenario. Given the situation the user is in, the app will do the best choice among the different possibilities.

## Acceptance criteria

- The app should be able to locate the user within one meter
- The app should not use 50% of the battery in a golf game within 5%
- The app should not be more than 100 Mo

## Design

## Non functional requirements

The app will be able to track the user's position while consuming a minimal amount of battery. The goal is that the user will be able to use it during a full golf game, which can approach five hours.

## Out of scope

Analysing the swing of the player by using the camera is not planned yet but is a possible improvement for the application.

Having the flag positions in real time is also not planned yet because it can change really often on certain course. However, by accessing a precise enough sattelite view, it would be possible to implement this feature.

Creating balls with sensors on them or putting sensors on other balls is also not planned. The main issues with those solutions are that the ball might not be balanced or not be up to standards anymore. The other issue is that if you do a bad shot and throw your ball in a lake or the woods, it may be impossible to recover them and it would cost a lot.

## Security

The only kind of sensitive data that would be stored is the golf course played. All the localisation processing will be done locally. To protect the player privacy, an asymetric encryption algorithm is planned.
