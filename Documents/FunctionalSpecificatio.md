## Goal and Scope

## Functional requirements

## Acceptance criteria

## Design

## Non functional requirements

## Out of scope

Analysing the swing of the player by using the camera is not planned yet but is a possible improvement for the application.

Having the flag positions in real time is also not planned yet because it can change really often on certain course. However, by accessing a precise enough sattelite view, it would be possible to implement this feature.

Creating balls with sensors on them or putting sensors on other balls is also not planned. The main issues with those solutions are that the ball might not be balanced or not be up to standards anymore. The other issue is that if you do a bad shot and throw your ball in a lake or the woods, it may be impossible to recover them and it would cost a lot.
